"Transsexualism" - the condition of being transsexual - is a medical diagnosis listed in the [ICD-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10), the international classification system for medical conditions. It is [defined as](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/F64.0):

> "A desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex."

Many (but not all) transsexual people also describe themselves as [transgender]({% link _words/transgender.md %}) and/or [nonbinary]({% link _words/nonbinary.md %}).

"Transgender" and [trans]({% link _words/trans.md %}) describe a much wider group of people than transsexual, and not all transgender and nonbinary people are transsexual or wish to use the term transsexual.

> "The terms 'transsexual' and 'transsexualism' are often considered old-fashioned and stigmatising, and this terminology is increasingly being replaced by terms, such as 'transgender' and 'trans', which many people deem more acceptable."

However, because transsexual is an older term, some people will prefer to use it simply because it is more familiar to them. 

Some people will avoid using this word because the word "sexual" sounds like it implies a sexuality. However, in recent years some people have been re-adopting "transsexual".

Transsexual is sometimes abbreviated to "TS". However, because this abbreviation is popular in pornography, some people who are otherwise comfortable using "transsexual" might still avoid "TS".
