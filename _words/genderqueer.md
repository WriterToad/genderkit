### Slur

The term [queer]({% link _words/queer.md %}) is often used as a slur - a word used to attack and insult people. As a result, people may find the word - or words like "genderqueer" that contain it - to be upsetting.

Through the process of [reappropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation) some people now use the word positively. Whether to use reclaimed slurs is a personal choice - but if you do use them, be aware that they may offend or upset some people.
