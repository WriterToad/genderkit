### Where can I ask questions about surgery?

When you and your clinical team agree that you are ready for surgery on the NHS, the NHS Gender Dysphoria National Referral Support Services (GDNRSS) will process your referral to your chosen surgical provider. They have a Single Point of Access support line that you can call for information about your referral, the status of your chosen provider and practical information such as travel and parking, who can accompany you, what to take with you and where to report when you get there.

You can also book a virtual consultation with one of the GDNRSS Clinical Nurse Advisors who can provide information on:

- Surgical techniques used by various providers and surgeon teams
- Typical recovery times following surgery
- Potential post-surgical complications
- Surgical eligibility criteria, where providers have these in place
- Waiting times for surgical providers
- Supporting patients to change provider

You can contact the service by calling 01522 85 77 99 or by email. The service is open Monday to Friday from 9am until 5pm. You can find out more about the service in [this booklet](https://cavuhb.nhs.wales/files/specialised-medicine/welsh-gender-service/v2-gender-dysphoria-about-us-booklet-pdf/?content-type=application/pdf).
