NGICNS maintains a list of [NHS surgery providers](https://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/surgery/surgery-providers/) providing various gender-related surgeries. At the moment, all of these surgeons are based in England, so you will have to travel if you live in another part of the UK. If you have decided to pay for your own surgery, rather than using NHS funding, there are additional options available to you. For more information about these private surgery options read [our private surgery page]({% link _resources/private-surgery.md %}).
