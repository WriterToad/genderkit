<p>NHS procedures for people aged 16 and younger in England and Wales are currently being reviewed and this information may not reflect your experience. More information about referrals to youth services in England and Wales can be found on <a href="https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/services/clinical-support/national-referral-support-service-for-the-nhs-gender-incongruence-service-for-children-and-young-people/">the Arden and GEM website</a>.</p>

### Step-by-step: how to get medical support
   
1. *Do you need medical support?*

   Read our [formal diagnosis page]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) to decide if a medical service is right for you.
2. *Choose the right service*

   Read our [page about all of your options]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) and our [tips for choosing a gender service]({% link _resources/choosing-gender-service.md %}). If you can afford it, and are over 18, using both private and NHS services together can help you access hormones more quickly.
3. *Get your referrals*

   Read our [how to get referred page]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}) for more information. 

   Once you are referred you will be placed onto a wait list. We have a page with [information about wait times]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}). If youâ€™d like to begin hormone therapy while you are waiting you can also ask your GP for a [bridging prescription]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

4. *Attend assessment appointments*

   Read our [first appointments page]({% link _resources/initial-appointment.md %}) so you know what to expect. 

   Once the assessment is complete you may be given a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}). 

5. *Under 18 only: further assessments*

   Young people using NHS gender services will have two additional assessment appointments with the UCLH team.
6. *Under 18 only: get puberty blockers*

   Young people may then be offered [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) and [GnRH agonist]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) medication. Access to GnRH agonists may be affected by future changes to NHS services.
7. *Approval for hormone treatment*

   In the UK, gender services may allow you to start hormones at this point if either:
   - you are over 18
   - or you are over 15, have taken blockers for more than a year

   and your clinical team feel you are ready to begin. 
   
   [Services based outside the UK]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}) may not require you to meet these criteria.
   
   Read our [hormones page]({% link _resources/hormones.md %}) for more information about hormones.

   If you are using a private service you will need to book an appointment with a private endocrinologist to begin your hormone treatment. After that appointment your endocrinologist can write to your GP to request shared care.
8. *Onward referrals*

   If you are over 18, you can ask for referrals to services such as [speech therapy]({% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %}), [surgery]({% link _resources/surgery.md %}), and [laser]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}) hair removal. If you have not undertaken it already, you can also ask for a [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) referral (ideally before hormone treatment is started).
