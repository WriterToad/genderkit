### Step-by-step: how to get medical support
   
1. *Do you need medical support?*

   Read our [formal diagnosis page]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) to decide if a medical service is right for you.
2. *Choose the right service*

   Read our [page about all of your options]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) and our [tips for choosing a gender service]({% link _resources/choosing-gender-service.md %}). If you can afford it, and are over 18, using both private and NHS services together can help you access hormones more quickly.
3. *Get your referrals*

   Read our [how to get referred page]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}) for more information. 

   Once you are referred you will be placed onto a wait list. We have a page with [information about wait times]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}). If youâ€™d like to begin hormone therapy while you are waiting you can also ask your GP for a [bridging prescription](https://www.transactual.org.uk/bridging-prescriptions).

4. *Attend assessment appointments*

   Read our [first appointments page]({% link _resources/initial-appointment.md %}) so you know what to expect. 

   Once the assessment is complete you may be given a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}). 

5. *Under 18 only: further assessments*

   Young people using NHS gender services will have two additional assessment appointments with the UCLH team.
6. *Under 18 only: get puberty blockers*

   Young people may then be offered [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) and [GnRH agonist]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) medication.
7. *Approval for hormone treatment*

   In the UK, gender services may allow you to start hormones at this point if either:
   - you are over 18
   - or you are over 15 and have taken blockers for more than a year

   and your clinical team feel you are ready to begin. 
   
   [Services based outside the UK]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}) may not require you to meet these criteria.
   
   Read our [hormones page]({% link _resources/hormones.md %}) for more information about hormones.

   If you are using a private service you will need to book an appointment with a private endocrinologist to begin your hormone treatment. After that appointment your endocrinologist can write to your GP to request shared care.
8. *Onward referrals*

   If you are over 18, you can ask for referrals to services such as [speech therapy]({% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %}), [surgery]({% link _resources/surgery.md %}), and [laser]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}) hair removal. If you have not undertaken it already, you can also ask for a [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) referral (ideally before hormone treatment is started).
