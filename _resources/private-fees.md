Costs for private services vary significantly. Appointments with private clinicians tend to cost £250-500, and you are likely to be asked to attend:

- at least one or two initial assessment appointments (or more if under 18)
- an appointment with an endocrinologist to be prescribed hormones
- periodic followup appointments with the endocrinologist

You may also need to pay prescription costs, costs for blood tests, and costs for injection supplies, depending on whether your GP agrees to a shared care agreement with the private clinic.

### Prescription costs

If you are using private gender services to obtain medications, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. Guidance on shared care that you may wish to give to your GP to help them make this decision has been produced by [NHS England](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) and [NHS Wales](https://awmsg.nhs.wales/files/guidelines-and-pils/shared-care-prescribing-and-monitoring-guidance-pdf/).

If your GP agrees to prescribe on the NHS, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. You do not have to pay the full cost of medication you are prescribed on the NHS. You are not asked to pay anything at all in [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/prescriptions), [Scotland](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs) and [Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs). In England, people are asked to pay a small charge for each item on their prescriptions. There are ways you can reduce or avoid this cost, which you can read about on [the NHS website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs).

If your GP does not agree to prescribe on the NHS, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of yourself. Typical prices for commonly used medications (as of February 2022) are:

- *testosterone gel*: around £50 for a two month supply
- *testosterone injections*: around £5-6 every 2-4 weeks for Sustanon, £100 for three months for Nebido
- *oestrogen gel*: around £10 for a 2-8 weeks supply
- *oestrogen patches*: around £10 for a 2-4 weeks supply
- *oestrogen pills*: around £10 for a 1-4 weeks supply
- *GnRH agonists*: around £250-300 for a 3 month supply

The private service may sometimes charge you an additional fee for writing the private prescription.

### Other costs

If you are taking a medication that is injected, you will also need injection supplies. You can find information about how to obtain these supplies cheaply and easily on [our self-injection page]({% link _resources/injections.md %}).

If your GP does not agree to perform blood testing for you, you will also need to arrange for this, which may cost you additional money. You can find out more about arranging blood testing on [our blood testing page]({% link _resources/blood-testing.md %}).

### Other considerations

There are other factors apart from costs that you may want to consider when choosing a private service. You can read more about things to consider on our [Choosing a Gender Service page]({% link _resources/choosing-gender-service.md %}).
