### How can I get hormones without a diagnosis?

In the UK, there are a number of different ways you can access hormone therapy:

- using an NHS gender service
- using a private gender service
- [using a gender service outside the UK](#using-a-gender-service-outside-of-the-uk)
- [bridging prescriptions](#bridging-prescriptions)
- [self-medicating](#self-medicating)

For the last three options you don't need a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), but you should consider the pros and cons of each approach carefully. You can read more about your options on this page.

### Using a gender service outside of the UK

You may opt to access HRT services outside the UK. Here are some pros and cons of choosing an overseas service:

{% include iconlist iconlist="clinic-outside-uk" %}

In the UK, many people looking for an overseas service use [GenderGP](https://www.gendergp.com/). 

Services outside the UK may give you a prescription written by a doctor in the EU. Some UK pharmacies may refuse to accept these, even though a prescription being from the EU rather than the UK does not make the prescription invalid. If you experience problems with your pharmacy, you may wish to show them the information about filling an EU prescription on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prescriptions-issued-in-the-eea-and-switzerland-guidance-for-pharmacists) and [the Royal Pharmaceutical Society website](https://www.rpharms.com/about-us/news/details/Prescriptions-issued-in-the-EEA-and-Switzerland-guidance-for-pharmacists), or ask [local groups]({% link _resources/local.md %}) for recommendations for pharmacies to use.

### Bridging prescriptions

A bridging prescription provides temporary HRT from your GP while you wait for a diagnosis.

{% include iconlist iconlist="bridging" %}

Waiting lists for NHS services are notoriously long, and you might be able to convince your GP that it's unreasonable to expect you to wait that long for hormones {% cite cr181 --locator 25 %}. However, current GMC guidance is for GPs to prescribe bridging prescriptions only when a patient is already self-medicating, or is likely to start self-medicating, and is at risk of self-harm or suicide {% cite GMCTransBridging %}. The guidelines also suggest providing only the minimum dose {% cite GMCTransBridging %}, which some GPs interpret as being the smallest possible dose, rather than the smallest effective dose. If your GP is uncertain about providing a bridging prescription, you can suggest they speak to their local NHS gender service for advice.

You can find more information about bridging prescriptions on [the TransActual website](https://www.transactual.org.uk/bridging-prescriptions).

### Self-medicating

Self-medicating means buying hormones directly yourself without a prescription.

{% include iconlist iconlist="self-med" %}

Unmonitored hormone therapy carries several risks. If you're already taking hormones from another source, your GP should strongly consider providing a bridging prescription and monitoring blood tests {% cite cr181 --locator 21 %}. You may have to convince them that without safe access to medication you will be at a greater risk of self-harm or suicide {% cite GMCTransBridging %}.

Regardless of where you get your hormones, regular blood tests are essential to ensure your hormone levels are safe and that there are no problems. You can read more about blood tests on [our blood testing page]({% link _resources/blood-testing.md %}). If your GP is unable or unwilling to give you blood tests at the practice, read [our page on dealing with common problems]({% link _resources/problems.md %}) for more suggestions.

{%capture warn%}
Testosterone is a *controlled substance* and illegal to sell, import, or share under UK law.
{%endcapture%}
{%include warning warning=warn%}

As testosterone is illegal to import into or sell in the UK, it can only be purchased on the "grey market" from vendors who are willing to break the law. Giving testosterone to someone else - even for free - can also have serious legal consequences [including time in prison](https://www.gov.uk/penalties-drug-possession-dealing).

If you are injecting medications yourself, read [our self-injections page]({% link _resources/injections.md %}) for information about safety, obtaining injection supplies, and correct disposal of waste.

{%capture warn%}
Medications not bought from a legitimate pharmaceutical supplier can be dangerous or ineffective.
{%endcapture%}
{%include warning warning=warn%}

Many medications sold online do not contain any active ingredients and are a waste of your money. Even if the medications are genuine, their safety and purity are not guaranteed unless you have bought them from a legitimate pharmacy.

Finally, it is important to note that if you are self medicating, your access to hormones may be affected in the event that you are admitted as an inpatient at a hospital or psychiatric facility. 

### How do I talk to my GP?

When talking to your GP, the following references may be useful:

- The NHS England service specification {% cite specEngNonsurgical --locator 30 %} states:

  > Endocrine and other pharmacological interventions may be recommended by a registered medical practitioner in the specialist multi-disciplinary team where they are essential for the purpose of harm reduction, and where they are in the individualâ€™s best interest for reducing gender dysphoria, when assisting the individual in achieving gender expression congruent with their identity and consistent with their treatment goals.

- The NGICNS Explanatory Notes to the Scottish gender protocol {% cite ngicnsExplanatoryNotes --locator 5 %} states:

  > Some service users may already be on hormonal treatment prior to referral, either through previous prescription or self medication. It is appropriate to continue this treatment following engagement with the GIC whilst Assessment One is undertaken. Appropriate prescribing guidelines and monitoring requirements are detailed in Endocrine Management of Adult Transgender Service users (NGICNS) and all service users should be made aware of this guidance and prescribing and monitoring of treatment brought in line with this guidance.

Some GPs are hesitant to prescribe hormones as they are unfamiliar with standard HRT treatments for trans people. However, they will be familiar with the same medications used for other purposes, such as treating hypogonadism, hormone-sensitive cancers, or menopausal symptoms; the GMC {% cite GMCTransPrescribing %} notes that

> Most of the medications used for the treatment of gender dysphoria are not licensed for this specific indication, although GPs will be familiar with their use in primary care for other purposes.

A number of gender clinics have published prescribing guidelines that your GP may find useful; you can find a list of these in [the Hormones section on genderarchive.org.uk](https://genderarchive.org.uk/tag/hormones/).
