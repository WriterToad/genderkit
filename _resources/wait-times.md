### Important notes

<section class="info">
<h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>
<p>Waiting times indicate how long patients who have just been invited for an appointment have waited for. As demand is currently increasing over time, this means it is likely you will wait <em>longer</em> than the time shown on this page.</p>
</section>

Waiting time information shown on this page is taken from information given directly to us by the services or published on their website.

Many gender services currently have very lengthy wait lists, and it can be very difficult to be waiting for so long. You can find ways you can get help while you are waiting on [our Mental Health page]({% link _resources/mental-health.md %}).

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}

*Youth services*: note that the wait shown for GIDS is an *average* wait, and your actual wait may be considerably longer or shorter than that shown above. Recent waits for GIDS patients (2021) have in some cases been as long as 38 months {% cite gids2022foi %}. GIDS patients approved for puberty blockers will be then referred to the UCLH paediatric endocrinology unit, which may entail an additional referral and assessment process that may take around six months {% cite nagids2022foi %}. After starting puberty blockers, GIDS require a further wait of at least a year before prescribing cross-sex hormones {% cite gids2022puberty %}.

{% include wait-transfer tag="Gender Clinics" icon="arrow" title="Transfers" free=true description="NHS gender services vary in how they handle wait times for patients transferring from the wait list of another NHS gender service. The following table shows whether your original referral date will be honoured if you transfer to each service. This information was based on information on the websites of the services when we last checked, but you may wish to confirm what rules would apply to you by contacting the gender service yourself before arranging a transfer to them." %}

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="pound" title="Paid UK-based services" free=false description="There are also several private gender services which charge fees but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists. You may wish to use these services while on the waiting list for an NHS service." %}

{% include wait-full tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}
