### Important notes

<section class="info">
<h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>
<p>Waiting times indicate how long patients who have just been invited for an appointment have waited for. As demand is currently increasing over time, this means it is likely you will wait <em>longer</em> than the time shown on this page.</p>
</section>

Waiting time information shown on this page is taken from information given directly to us by the services or published on their website.

Many gender services currently have very lengthy wait lists, and it can be very difficult to be waiting for so long. You can find ways you can get help while you are waiting on [our Mental Health page]({% link _resources/mental-health.md %}).

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}

*Youth services*: Information about referrals for under 17s in England and Wales can be found on [the Arden and GEM website](https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/services/clinical-support/national-referral-support-service-for-the-nhs-gender-incongruence-service-for-children-and-young-people/). As of August 2023 there are nearly 8000 patients on the youth service wait list, and patients have been waiting up to 5 years ([source](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/gender_dysphoria_services_waitin)). 

{% include wait-transfer tag="Gender Clinics" icon="arrow" title="Transfers" free=true description="NHS gender services vary in how they handle wait times for patients transferring from the wait list of another NHS gender service. The following table shows whether your original referral date will be honoured if you transfer to each service. This information was based on information on the websites of the services when we last checked, but you may wish to confirm what rules would apply to you by contacting the gender service yourself before arranging a transfer to them." %}

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="pound" title="Paid UK-based services" free=false description="There are also several private gender services which charge fees but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists. You may wish to use these services while on the waiting list for an NHS service." %}

{% include wait-full tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen.
