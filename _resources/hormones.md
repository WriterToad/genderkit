### What different kinds of hormones are there?

We have pages with information about the most commonly used medications in hormone replacement therapy for people who are changing things about their body linked to gender:

- [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %})
- [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})
- [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) ("blockers") which block the effects of oestrogen and testosterone
- [progesterone]({% link _articles/progesterone.md %})
- [spironolactone]({% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}) and [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) help block the effects of testosterone but often have more side effects
- [finasteride]({% link _articles/finasteride.md %}) (a medication sometimes used to reduce some effects from testosterone)
- [anastrozole]({% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}) (an oestrogen blocker not normally used in the UK)
