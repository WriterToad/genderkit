### Important notes

{% include wait-markdown tag="Gender Clinics" %}

The table above is a summary of the \[full list of waiting times\](https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/wait-times/) we have on Gender Construction Kit. We generally try to update this every three months, by compiling figures the clinics have published and by submitting Freedom of Information requests.


As an NHS patient, you have the right to choose your care provider, but you’ll generally be limited to what clinics are in the same country as your GP. On top of that, all clinics in Scotland other than Sandyford are limited to specific regions.


Most NHS clinics will expect you to attend a minimum of two appointments before approval for hormones is given - so we've also listed the time to get a follow-up appointment.


Keep in mind that the data here is based on how long the wait was for the people who are being seen now. It’s likely that if you were referred today, you’d end up waiting significantly longer, as the waiting times have been on an upward trend for a while now. Unfortunately, these wait times are far in excess of the 18-week limit \[set out in the NHS constitution](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/hospitals/guide-to-nhs-waiting-times-in-england/).

*Youth services*: Informations about referrals for under 17s in England and Wales can be found on [the Arden and GEM website](https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/services/clinical-support/national-referral-support-service-for-the-nhs-gender-incongruence-service-for-children-and-young-people/). As of August 2023 there are nearly 8000 patients on the youth service wait list, and patients have been waiting up to 5 years ([source](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/gender_dysphoria_services_waitin)). 

If you’re finding your wait difficult or stressful, we have some information on ways to get support on our \[mental health page](https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/mental-health/).

If you’re interested in how we make our FOI requests or want to make some of your own, we’ve written a \[blog post](http://blog.genderkit.org.uk/2021/07/04/gic-foia.html) about it!
