### Advice and guidance

There is a very useful guide for trans people who have been affected by sexual violence on [the LGBT Foundation website](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lgbt-website-media/Files/14134885-0494-4588-9a36-0de65a71e099/Trans%2520Guide%2520Sexual%2520Violence.pdf).

More general advice for survivors is available on the NHS website:

- [Help after rape and sexual assault](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/help-after-rape-and-sexual-assault/)
- [Getting help for domestic violence](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/getting-help-for-domestic-violence/)

### Information for young people

If you're under 19 and facing any sort of violence or abuse, [Childline](https://www.childline.org.uk) has information, advice, and [a helpline](https://www.childline.org.uk/get-support/contacting-childline/) for you to contact.

### UK organisations supporting survivors

{% include organisations tag="Violence" %}

The [Rape Crisis Scotland helpline](https://www.rapecrisisscotland.org.uk/help-helpline/) is for anyone, whatever their gender, who has been affected by sexual violence, no matter when or how it happened. They offer both phone and email support.

The [GALOP Helpline](https://galop.org.uk/get-help/helplines/) supports LGBT people, their friends and families across the UK. The helpline is for LGBT+ people experiencing abuse or violence, such as hate crime, domestic abuse, sexual violence, so-called “conversion therapy” or any other kind of abuse. They operate a freephone telephone helpline service as well as online chat and email support.

There is a 1-to-1 [LGBT* domestic violence support service](https://lgbt.foundation/domesticabuse) run by LGBT Foundation based in Manchester.

### If you're worried about someone else

It can be difficult to know what to do if you're worried about someone else.

Thankfully, you can find information about what to do online on the NHS website:

- [Supporting a victim of sexual assault](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/help-after-rape-and-sexual-assault/#supporting-a-victim-of-sexual-assault)
- [Helping a friend if they're being abused](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/getting-help-for-domestic-violence/#helping-a-friend-if-theyre-being-abused)
- [Spotting signs of child sexual abuse](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/spotting-signs-of-child-sexual-abuse/)

If you're worried about someone's mental health or whether they are thinking of hurting themselves, we have a page on [mental health]({% link _resources/mental-health.md %}) with more information.
