### What surgeries are available?

If you're over 18 and have a [formal gender diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will fund:

{% include iconlist iconlist="surgery1" %}

There is a considerable wait to access medical support from the NHS. If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), you can [pay for these surgeries yourself]({% link _resources/private-surgery.md %}), which can mean a shorter wait.

The following surgeries are not normally funded by the NHS gender pathway, but gender services can write to your GP to ask they refer you:

{% include iconlist iconlist="surgery2" %}

These surgeries are not normally funded by the NHS:

{% include iconlist iconlist="surgery3" %}

Approval for funding for these surgeries is very occasionally given on an individual basis.

### How do I choose a surgical team?

For some surgeries there are a large number of teams that will offer the surgery in the UK. You can find a complete list of UK surgeons who can be accessed via the NHS on [the NGICNS website](https://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/surgery/surgery-providers/). If you have decided to pay for your own surgery, rather than using NHS funding, there are additional options available to you. For more information about these private surgery options read [our private surgery page]({% link _resources/private-surgery.md %}).

You can find useful tips for deciding which surgery team to use on [the Umbrella Cymru website](https://umbrellagwent.od2.vtiger.com/kb/article/396664-Choosing-your-surgeon?catid=1&subid=4).

### How can I get ready for surgery?
