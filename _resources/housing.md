### Information for young people

If you're under 16 and homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless, you can contact Children's Services at your local council. However, they will generally try to sort things so that you can stay at home, and will only look for alternatives if that is dangerous or impossible. You can find more information about this on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/your-rights-to-housing-if-youre-under-18).
