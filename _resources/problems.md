### How do I get my problem fixed?

Here's how to handle some common issues with the UK healthcare system:

{% capture title %}My GP doesn't know how to update my name or gender marker{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
Read [our Updating NHS Records page]({% link _articles/updating-nhs-patient-details.md %}) for information on talking to your GP surgery.

{% endcapture %}
{% include details body=body title=title %}    

{% capture title %}My GP doesn't know how to refer me to a gender service{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
First check to see if it is possible to refer yourself to the gender service. You can find this information on [our UK Gender Services page]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}).

If your GP is unsure what the next step should be, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the General Medical Council](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#mental-health-and-bridging-prescriptions) - it is their responsibility to read this information and to be familiar with it. If you're still not able to get a referral, you may find contacting the service you want to be referred to can help.

{% capture title %}I have a problem with my hormone treatment{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
First speak to the person who monitors your hormone therapy - usually your GP. 

If they are unsure how to help, you can suggest they get advice from one of these sources:

- NHS prescribing policies for trans people
- an endocrinologist who originally recommended your hormone therapy
- the endocrinology team at an NHS gender service
- a local NHS endocrinology team if there is one in your area with expertise working with trans patients
{% endcapture %}
{% include details body=body title=title %}    

{% capture title %}I have a problem with my gender surgery referral{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
If you have problems with your gender surgery referral, the NHS Gender Dysphoria National Referral Support Services (GDNRSS) have a Single Point of Access support line that you can call for information and advice about your referral. You can read how to access the service in [this booklet](https://cavuhb.nhs.wales/files/specialised-medicine/welsh-gender-service/v2-gender-dysphoria-about-us-booklet-pdf/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include details body=body title=title %}    

{% capture title %}My GP isn't willing to offer bridging prescriptions{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
Read the [TransActual guide to bridging prescriptions](https://www.transactual.org.uk/bridging-prescriptions) for more information on what you can do.

GPs are free to decide not to offer bridging prescriptions for a number of reasons, such as if you do not meet the criteria listed in [the GMC guidance](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#Mental%20health%20and%20bridging%20prescriptions), or because they do not feel comfortable doing so. Many requests for bridging prescriptions are unsuccessful.

{% capture title %}My GP isn't willing to offer shared care or blood testing{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
In some local areas, there are restrictions on who GPs can make shared care agreements with, but normally your GP can choose whether to offer you shared care. 

To help them make this decision, you can offer your GP information such as:

- the guidance on prescribing for trans people on [the GMC website](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#Prescribing) (which covers prescribing "unlicensed medications")
- the guidance to GPs on shared care agreements with private clinics [published by NHS England](https://www.dpt.nhs.uk/download/VjSSV5TQVv)
- whether the clinicians that have diagnosed you are [GMC registered](https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/the-medical-register) and are a [registered specialist in gender dysphoria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-recognition-certificate-list-of-medical-practitioners-in-gender-dysphoria/doctors-and-psychologists-specialising-in-gender-dysphoria)

If your GP does not feel comfortable prescribing for you, you can ask your private endocrinologist to write prescriptions for you instead. Your NHS GP may still be willing to perform blood testing for you, but if not, you can find other blood testing services on [our Blood Testing page]({% link _resources/blood-testing.md %}).

{% capture title %}I have another problem with my GP surgery{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
If you're having a problem with the care you're receiving from a GP, start by talking to the reception staff of the GP surgery by email or phone call.

### That didn't help, what can I do?

If you want to make a complaint, read [our page on how to do it]({% link _resources/complaints.md %}).

If your GP surgery is unhelpful or unsupportive, you might want to consider:

- *speaking to the practice manager*

    The practice manager is the head of the GP surgery. You can request to talk to the practice manager on the phone or in-person, and this is often the quickest way to get problems resolved if you're experiencing issues with their staff.

- *switching to a different GP at the surgery*

    You have the right to change to a different GP at your GP surgery without giving a reason why. If you are uncomfortable with a particular GP, you can also ask to be given appointments with any other GP.

- *changing to another GP surgery*

    You can search for GP surgeries near to you that the trans community have found helpful on [the Trans Healthcare Info GP map](https://www.transhealthcareintel.com/trans-friendly-gps) or [the Trans Aid Cymru Welsh GP map](https://transaid.cymru/our-projects/#gpmap).

- *changing to an online GP service*

    Some online services specifically advertise support for LGBT+ and trans people, such as [GP At Hand](https://www.babylonhealth.com/en-gb/lgbtq).

You can also get support to help you resolve your problem from these sources:

- in London, people over 18 can access [the Spectra Trans Health Advocacy Service](https://spectra-london.org.uk/trans-services/trans-health-advocacy/)
- in Manchester and Greater Manchester, people over 16 can access [the LGBT Foundation Trans Advocacy service](http://lgbt.foundation/how-we-can-help-you/trans-advocacy)
