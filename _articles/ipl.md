### How do I stay safe?

Remember to check the official inspection reports for your IPL clinic before you attend to check that their staff are properly trained and work safely:

- in Wales, you can read the reports on [the Healthcare in Wales website](http://hiw.org.uk/find-service/?lang=en)
- in Northern Ireland, you can read the reports on [the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority website](https://www.rqia.org.uk/inspections/view-inspections-as/map/)
- in England, unfortunately reports are not available for all clinics, but some can be found by typing in the search box on [the Care Quality Commission website](https://www.cqc.org.uk)
- in Scotland, unfortunately reports are not available for all clinics, but some can be found by typing in the search box on [the Healthcare Improvement Scotland website](https://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.scot/inspections-reviews-and-regulation/regulation-of-independent-healthcare/find-an-independent-healthcare-provider-or-service/)

You may also may want to ask a [local group]({% link _resources/local.md %}) for people changing things related to gender to find out if people have had any problems with the clinic.

### What should I be aware of?

IPL is less suitable than laser hair reduction for people with darker skin {% cite gan2013laser %}.

### How does it work?

Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy is an alternative to [laser hair reduction]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) that uses a bright flash of light from a xenon flashbulb that produces many different wavelengths - rather than the single wavelength used by a laser.

### Are there other options?

A similar technique is [laser hair reduction]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}). Medical studies have yet to come to a clear conclusion about whether IPL is more or less effective than laser hair reduction. Some studies have suggested that treatment with IPL is less effective {% cite klein2013photoepilation ormiga2014comparison %}, while others have found no difference {% cite gan2013laser szima2017comparison %}. NHS Scotland have produced guidance suggesting that IPL therapy may work less effectively on thicker hairs with deeper roots {% cite ngicns2022facial -l 8 %}.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about facial hair removal methods in [this booklet produced by the NHS GDNRSS]({% link assets/pdf/PIL Facial Hair Reduction v5.pdf %}).

### What else might I want?

IPL hair reduction may be painful or uncomfortable. You can reduce the discomfort by asking your GP to prescribe you lidocaine and prilocaine cream, also known as EMLA cream. This is a local anaesthetic, applied directly onto the skin, which numbs the skin so you feel less pain from the treatment. You will normally need to apply the cream around an hour before your treatment.
