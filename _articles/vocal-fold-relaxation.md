### What should I be aware of?

Vocal fold relaxation is a new and uncommon surgical technique that has the ability to significantly lower the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the voice {% cite davies2015voice -l 147 %}.

There are currently only a few small-scale short-term medical studies into using this technique in humans {% cite remacle2010relaxation kocak2008window %}, and how safe and effective it is long-term remains unknown.

It is also possible to increase the mass of the vocal chords by injecting them with fat from other parts of the body. This approach normally requires periodic "top up" injections {% cite antoni2017 -l 329 %}.

Both techniques are currently rarely used.

### What else might I want?

[Thyroid chondroplasty]({% link _articles/thyroid-chondroplasty.md %}) is often carried out during surgeries that affect the voice - either to reduce the number of operations required, or because those surgeries would otherwise make the Adam's apple more apparent.
