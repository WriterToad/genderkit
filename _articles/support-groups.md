### How can support groups help me?

Support groups can:

*   provide a safe place to discuss your experiences
*   give you a chance to meet other trans people
*   be a useful source of practical information

### How do I find support groups near me?

The following might run support groups or be able to give you a list of local ones:

- [NHS gender services]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %})
- [local LGBTQIA+ organisations]({% link _resources/local.md %})
- [trans support services]({% link _articles/support-services.md %})
- university LGBTQIA+ societies or networks
- other local trans people
- your GP

### What should I be aware of?

Support groups vary in their format, focus and size, although most groups will give you the opportunity to discuss your experiences and to listen to others.

Before attending a support group it is a good idea to contact the person leading it to find out more. Here are some questions to consider:

*   Is it a trans-focused group or an LGBTQIA+ group?
*   How many people usually attend?
*   Will you be expected to speak, or can you just listen?
*   What issues will the support group cover?
*   What do the meetings involve?
*   Do you need someone to go with you as support?

### Are there other options?

Other sources of support you could consider are:

*   one-to-one [trans support services]({% link _articles/support-services.md %})
*   [social groups]({% link _articles/social-groups.md %})
*   [counselling]({% link _articles/counselling.md %})
*   youth groups
