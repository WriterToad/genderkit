### What should I be aware of?

Support groups vary in their format, focus and size, although most groups will give you the opportunity to discuss your experiences and to listen to others.

Before attending a support group it is a good idea to contact the person leading it to find out more. Here are some questions to consider:

*   Is it a trans-focused group or an LGBTQIA+ group?
*   How many people usually attend?
*   Will you be expected to speak, or can you just listen?
*   What issues will the support group cover?
*   What do the meetings involve?
*   Do you need someone to go with you as support?

### Are there other options?

*   one-to-one [trans support services]({% link _articles/support-services.md %})
*   [social groups]({% link _articles/social-groups.md %})
