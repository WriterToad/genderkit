### What should I be aware of?

There are only a small number of studies of the effects of alfatradiol on hair loss, and there is no clear conclusion on whether it is effective {% cite varothai2014androgenetic -l 221 %}.

In the UK, the more proven options of [minoxidil]({% link _articles/minoxidil.md %}) and [finasteride]({% link _articles/finasteride.md %}) are used instead.

### How much will it cost?

Alfatradiol treatment is not funded by the NHS.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about hair loss treatments on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hair-loss/).
