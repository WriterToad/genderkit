### How do I choose a concealer?

Concealer comes in different shades, and it is important to match the shade you use to your natural skin colour. Shops selling makeup will usually have "testers" that you can apply to part of your skin to compare the makeup to your skin tone. Some shops also offer a service to help you find the correct makeup colour for your skin tone.

### How do I use concealer?

Concealer can be used on its own or under other makeup. Concealer is applied using either a concealer brush, a makeup sponge, or cotton wool. You may find that concealer leaves your skin shiny - if so, you can try applying powder to reduce this.

When you have finished wearing your makeup, for example when you want to go to sleep, you will need to remove it. You can use a normal facial wash to do this on most of your face, but on the delicate skin around your eyes you may wish to use eye makeup removal pads or cotton wool and some eye makeup remover.
