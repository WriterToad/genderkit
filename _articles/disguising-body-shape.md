### Why might I want to disguise my body shape?

You might want to hide, minimise, emphasise, or enhance certain parts of your body shape in order to feel more comfortable. A variety of techniques can be used to alter the appearance of these areas.

### How do I disguise my body shape?

This is not a science, and not all techniques will work for everyone: there are no hard and fast rules in fashion. You can try these ideas to find out which work on your body, and use them as inspiration for finding more ideas unique to your personal style.

### Avoiding common problems

- Some people find that their arms look too small for the arms of t-shirts. One solution to this is to wear vest tops instead - and some people convert t-shirts into vests themselves.
- If you find that t-shirts or shirts do not fit properly around your hips and are being stretched out, you can try to find ones that split at the sides at the bottom, as these can better accommodate larger hips.
