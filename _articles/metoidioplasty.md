### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Metoidioplasty is a complex surgical procedure with significant risks that you must understand before it is carried out. Complications are common in this operation, particularly problems with urinating which may require surgical correction, including urethral strictures and fistulas (urethra closing up so you cannot urinate) {% cite frey2017update -l 732 %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

### Why might I want metoidioplasty?

The main effect of a metoidioplasty is to enlarge the apparent size of the clitoris. In a metoidioplasty, the clitoris is detached from the labia and the ligaments which hold the clitoris are cut. This "releases" the clitoris, adding 2-4cm in length and allows the clitoris to point upwards {% cite christopher2017 -l 296 %}.

If you wish to be able to urinate from the end of the clitoris, urethroplasty (construction of an extension of the urethra) can also be performed along with metoidioplasty. This is an optional procedure - you may not have this procedure and continue urinating from your existing urethral opening if you want, though this would require continuing to sit to urinate or using a stand to pee device. Avoiding a urethroplasty reduces the risk of complications {% cite cr181 -l 30 %}.

If you also wish to have a scrotum, you can optionally also have testicular implants added as part of a [scrotoplasty]({% link _articles/scrotoplasty.md %}) that takes place at the same time as a metoidioplasty {% cite christopher2017 -l 297 %}.

### Why might I not want metoidioplasty?

If the size is important to you, you might wish to avoid metoidioplasty and instead have [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}), surgery to create a penis. Phalloplasty usually creates an average sized penis, compared to the much smaller (5-7cm length) results of metoidioplasty. However, as metoidioplasty uses only clitoral tissue, it will usually provide an organ with good erogenous sensation which can become erect without the use of prostheses. Metoidioplasty also often requires less surgeries, less time in hospital, and less scarring.

### How do I get metoidioplasty?

Metoidioplasty first requires taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) which causes hypertrophy (enlargement) of the clitoris. Once this has occurred (usually after 1-2 years into taking testosterone), metoidioplasty can be carried out {% cite frey2017update -l 732 %}. 

In order to be accepted for a metoidioplasty, you will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.

{% include list-of-surgeons %}

Sometimes a metoidioplasty will be carried out during the same surgery as [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), [vaginectomy]({% link _articles/vaginectomy.md %}), or [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}). This can provide useful tissue for performing the urethroplasty.

For some people, metoidioplasty can provide a significant improvement in mental health. There is overall agreement in medical studies that after gender confirming medical interventions, rates of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric symptoms reduce considerably {% cite arcelus2017 -l 181 %}. However, as with other major life changes, you may find that [counselling]({% link _articles/counselling.md %}) before and after surgery may be helpful.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about metoidioplasty in [this booklet from the NHS Gender Dysphoria National Referral Support Service]({% link assets/pdf/Metoidioplasty_Masculinising_Surgery_Leaflet_v8.pdf %}).

You can find information and regular updates about waiting times for phalloplasty and metoidioplasty in the UK on [the TransActual website](https://transactual.org.uk/whats-happening-with-nhs-phallo-and-meta/).

There is some detailed information about phalloplasty and metoidioplasty on the [St. Peter's Andrology Centre website](https://www.andrology.co.uk/phalloplasty). Please note that St Peter's are no longer offering gender surgeries, so some information on this site may be out of date.

### How do I get ready for surgery?

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for metoidioplasty or [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}).

The NHS will normally fund hair removal from the donor skin sites for urethroplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}).

{% include travel-costs %}

If not funded by the NHS, the cost of a metoidioplasty performed in the UK is approximately £35,000 (last updated July 2020). The only clinic currently performing metoidioplasty in the UK is [New Victoria Hospital](https://www.newvictoria.co.uk/).
