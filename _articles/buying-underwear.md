### Why might I want to buy new underwear?

You might want to buy different underwear if:

- you do not want to wear "men's" or "women's" clothing and want something designed for people of all genders
- you prefer a style often associated with a different gender to the one you identify with
- you want to hide the appearance of your genitalia and want underwear to support [tucking]({% link _articles/tucking.md %})
- you want to create the appearance of different genitalia and want underwear to help with [packing]({% link _articles/packing.md %})
- you menstruate but don't want to use products such as towels or tampons, perhaps because of gendered associations you are uncomfortable with, or because the toilets you use do not have bins for disposing of them
- you use use menstruation products such as towels but the style of underwear you prefer normally does not accommodate them
