### Why might I want to buy new underwear?

You might want to buy underwear:

- designed *for people of all genders* because you do not want to wear "men's" or "women's" clothing
- designed in *a style often associated with a different gender* to the one you identify with
- designed for [tucking]({% link _articles/tucking.md %}) (hiding the appearance of your genitalia)
- designed for [packing]({% link _articles/packing.md %}) (adding objects into your underwear to create the impression of genitalia) because you are uncomfortable with the look of your crotch
- designed to allow *menstruation without using products* such as towels or tampons, perhaps because of gendered associations you are uncomfortable with, or because the toilets you use do not have bins for disposing of them
- designed to allow *using menstruation products* such as towels
