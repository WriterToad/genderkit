### Why might I want to buy new underwear?

You might want to buy different underwear if:

- you do not want to wear "men's" or "women's" clothing and want something designed for people of all genders
- you prefer a style often associated with a different gender to the one you identify with
- you want to hide the appearance of your genitalia and want underwear to support [tucking]({% link _articles/tucking.md %})
- you want your underwear to be designed for [packing]({% link _articles/packing.md %})
- you menstruate but don't want to use products such as towels or tampons, perhaps because of gendered associations you are uncomfortable with, or because the toilets you use do not have bins for disposing of them
- you use use menstruation products such as towels but the style of underwear you prefer normally does not accommodate them

### How do I work out my size?

There is no standardised sizing system for clothes, and a “32” will be a slightly different size when bought from each retailer. You will need to find the correct size for you in each place you buy clothes. Look for the words “size guide” or “size chart” on the website of the retailer.

Unlike other clothing, underwear cannot normally be returned after purchase if you find it does not fit. If you are unsure of whether something will fit you, you may wish to measure your body size carefully. Made sure that you are measuring in the correct location - some retailers will ask you to measure around the widest part of your hips, whereas other retailers will ask you to measure around the top of your hips.
