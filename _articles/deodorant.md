### What kinds are there?

- *Deodorants* are products that neutralise body odours. They often also add a fragrance to help conceal any remaining body odour.
- *Antiperspirants* additionally reduce the amount of sweat the body produces. Sweat encourages the growth of microbes that are responsible for body odours.

### Where can I learn more?

If you experience ongoing problems with body odour or excessive sweating, you can find more information and advice on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/body-odour-bo/).
