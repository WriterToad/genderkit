### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Hysterectomy results in permanent destruction of the uterus (womb) and is irreversible. After hysterectomy you will be unable to become pregnant or give birth.

{% capture warn %}
Not all types of hysterectomy remove the risk of cervical cancer. The cervix is only removed as part of an operation called a "total hysterectomy". Ask your surgeon whether you will still need to be regularly [tested for cervical cancer](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cervical-screening-test/Pages/Introduction.aspx) if you are unsure. You can read more about this on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/sexual-health/should-trans-men-have-cervical-screening-tests/).

Hysterectomy for people taking testosterone is optional and you may feel the risks involved in a major operation are unnecessary. If you decide not to undergo hysterectomy it has been suggested that scans to check for thickening of the endometrium every two years could reduce any potential risks {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}.

### Why might I want a hysterectomy?

Hysterectomies are usually carried out because of cancer or other tumours of the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes or ovaries. They are also sometimes carried out on people with very heavy periods. 

In the past, some clinicians have recommended that people taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) long-term should have a hysterectomy. They theorised that as testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which could lead to endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the lining of the womb), this might increase the risk of cancer {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}. However, subsequent studies have not shown any evidence of an increased risk of reproductive cancers from testosterone use, and they do not suggest any need for hysterectomy {% cite toze2018risky %}.

### Why might I not want a hysterectomy?

Hysterectomy is irreversible and permanently destroys the uterus. If you hope to become pregnant at some point, you may not want to have a hysterectomy.

### How do I get a hysterectomy?

To get a hysterectomy, you will need to be referred to a gynaecological department at a hospital, either by your GP or by a gender clinician. However, outside of Scotland, the NHS gender pathway only funds hysterectomy as part of a larger operation like [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) or [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}). If you don't wish to have one of these other operations, you can ask your gender service to write a letter to your GP asking them to refer you for a hysterectomy, or you can arrange for one privately.

To obtain hysterectomy for gender-related reasons, you will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications or is otherwise unable to take hormones) {% cite cr181 %}. 

Hysterectomy for other medical reasons is not subject to these requirements.

Hysterectomy is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend at least 4-6 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer.

### What kinds are there?

There several types of hysterectomy, which may or may not include removing the cervix or removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (also known as [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %})). If your hysterectomy does not involve salpingo-oophorectomy, you are still at risk of ovarian cancer {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}.

Hysterectomy does not usually involve removal of the vagina, which is called a [vaginectomy]({% link _articles/vaginectomy.md %}).

### How do I get ready for surgery?

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

{% capture info %}
Outside of Scotland, this is usually only funded as part of [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) or [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %})
{% endcapture %}
{% include regional regionalinfo=info %}

The NHS will normally fund total hysterectomy and [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}) for patients who are undergoing [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy.
