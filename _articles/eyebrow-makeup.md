### How do I use eyebrow makeup?

A number of makeup techniques can be used to make eyebrows appear darker, denser or thicker:

- *eyebrow pencil* can be used to draw in additional eyebrow hairs, either to change the shape of the brow, make it look thicker, or to cover gaps or patches.
- *gels* allow you to fix eyebrows in place after you have brushed them into a new position. They can also be tinted to provide the effect of darker eyebrows or conceal greying eyebrows.
- *waxes* provide a waterproof alternative to gels.
- *powders* are applied with a makeup brush and darken the whole eyebrow area.

When you have finished wearing your makeup, for example when you want to go to sleep, you will need to remove it. You can use a normal facial wash to do this on most of your face, but on the delicate skin around your eyes you may wish to use eye makeup removal pads or cotton wool and some eye makeup remover. 

### Are there other options?

It is also possible to use eyebrow pencil or [permanent makeup]({% link _articles/permanent-makeup.md %}) to entirely replace the eyebrow after removing existing eyebrow hair.
