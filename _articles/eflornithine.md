### Why might I want to use eflornithine?

You might use it as a temporary alternative measure for managing facial hair while you are waiting to access more permanent approaches, such as [laser hair reduction]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}) hair removal {% cite ngicns2022facial %}. This might be useful if:

- you cannot afford to pay for permanent approaches yet, and there is no funding for it in your area
- you are delaying permanent approaches until you are prescribed GnRH agonists or other anti-androgens so that a better result can be achieved

You may also choose to use eflornithine because you do not wish to make a permanent change to your body but would like less hair regrowth after shaving.

### Why might I not want to use eflornithine?

If you have very light coloured facial hair or minimal facial hair growth, and [shaving]({% link _articles/shaving.md %}) is effective at reducing the visibility of your facial hair, eflornithine might be unnecessary.

Eflornithine appears to only be effective for some people, and a significant proportion of people stop using Eflornithine because they see little or no effect from eflornithine {% cite vaniqua %}.

### How do I get eflornithine?

Eflornithine is only available in the UK by prescription {% cite vaniqua %}.

### How do I use eflornithine?

Eflornithine is a cream, applied to an area of the body twice a day, at least eight hours apart. Eflornithine takes up to eight weeks to work, and the original rate of hair growth resumes within eight weeks of stopping eflornithine. 

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about eflornithine cream on [the EMC website](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6398).

### How does it work?

Eflornithine inhibits an enzyme (ornithine decarboxylase) that is part of the process of hair growth {% cite seal:2007 --locator 165 %}.
