### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
This technique is a surgery with a number of risks you need to understand before it is carried out. Common side effects are a quieter voice, a voice with less vocal range, or decreased clarity. The surgery may also result in no change to the pitch of the voice or a deepening of the voice {% cite song2017transgender -l 807 %}.

{% include warning warning=warn %}

[Speech therapy]({% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %}) is able to allow the majority of people to raise the pitch and change the qualities of their voice.

However, for a minority of people this is not the case, and they may consider voice surgery as an alternative. Unlike speech therapy, voice surgery carries significant risks of complications, and the effects may be irreversible.

While a variety of different approaches to increasing vocal pitch have been tried, there is currently little research into what the long term effects of these surgeries are, and how long the effects will last is unknown {% cite van2017effectiveness -l 244e4 %}.

Voice surgery requires additional speech therapy after the surgery {% cite seal:2007 -l 194 %}.
