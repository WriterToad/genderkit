### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Not all breast tissue is removed in mastectomy, and it does not remove the risk of breast cancer.

{% capture info %}
Chest reconstruction surgeries on under 18s who have been on testosterone appear to have similar complications to those in young adults {% cite mahfouda2019 %}, but the research on this is limited.

Double incision mastectomy carries a risk of loss of sensation in the nipples or loss of the nipples entirely. If a nipple is completely lost, some people use cosmetic tattooing to give the appearance that the nipple is still there.

### Are there other options?

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the double incision mastectomy technique in the UK. Around 7% of people have little enough breast tissue and good skin elasticity for [periareolar mastectomy]({% link _articles/periareolar-mastectomy.md %}) to be recommended instead {% cite yelland2017 -l 261 %} which can result in less visible scarring {% cite davies2:2007 -l 227 %}. Other techniques are possible, such as buttonhole or inverted T (also known as T-anchor), but are much less common in the UK.

### How do I get a mastectomy?

Mastectomy for reasons of gender dysphoria requires a written letter of recommendation from a specialist gender clinician (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery {% cite cr181 %}.

Mastectomy usually requires an overnight stay in hospital {% cite cr181 -l 31 %}. Mastectomy is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend around 4-6 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer. You will also need to return for a follow up appointment to determine if any further surgery is required to improve the cosmetic appearance.

### How do I get ready for surgery?

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of a mastectomy and chest reconstruction performed in the UK is currently around £6000-7000 (last updated October 2020).

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for a mastectomy.
