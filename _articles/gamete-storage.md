### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Storing gametes does not guarantee the ability to later have children. Use of stored gametes only sometimes results in pregnancy.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

### Why might I want gamete storage?

A number of treatments and surgical procedures to change things related to gender may have infertility as a possible risk or a certain consequence.

Some people who intend to have children after their treatment will store gametes (sperm or eggs) before they start treatment. These can later be used when they are ready to have children. The gametes are frozen and can be later defrosted and used at a time when they are needed.

### Are there other options?

Instead of storing gametes, it is also possible to store embryos or reproductive tissue. The techniques for using reproductive tissue are currently experimental {% cite deroo2017 -l 137 %}.

Alternatives to using stored material are adopting or fostering children, using donated sperm or eggs from another person, or using a surrogate. 

### How much will it cost?

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) and the NHS will be providing medical treatments relating to gender that could affect your fertility, you may be able to access funding for gamete storage:

- *NHS England*: funding varies by local area based on rules set by your local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), with many CCGs now funding treatment.
- *NHS Wales*: gamete storage is funded for 10 years {% cite walesfertility -l 2 %}
- *NHS Scotland*: information can be found on [the NGICNS website](https://www.nn.nhs.scot/ngicns/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2023/04/NSD_GRP_OG_05-Endocrine-and-fertility-preservation-guidance-2022-v0.8.pdf)

As well as gamete storage, you may also want to research rules about funding for use of the stored material for IVF or IUI treatment. The Human Fertilisations and Embryology Authority have details of [costs and funding of gamete collection and storage](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/explore-all-treatments/costs-and-funding/), including options that may help you reduce costs such as egg sharing and treatment abroad. You also can use [their search tool](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/choose-a-clinic/clinic-search/) to find a clinic that will help you.

There are also a number of private options. This will generally cost several hundred for storing sperm, or several thousand for storing eggs. There will be extra costs per year you want to store them for.

### Where can I learn more?

There is detailed information about gamete storage and fertility treatments for trans and non-binary people on [the Human Fertilisations and Embryology Authority website](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/fertility-preservation/information-for-trans-and-non-binary-people-seeking-fertility-treatment/) and on [the Wales Fertility Institute website](https://www.umbrellacymru.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fertility-Preservation-Information-for-Gender-Diversity..V1.pdf).
