### More information

Permanent makeup can also be used on other parts of the body. This can be particularly useful if one or both nipples are lost due to complications of a [double incision mastectomy]({% link _articles/double-incision-mastectomy.md %}) or a [periareolar mastectomy]({% link _articles/periareolar-mastectomy.md %}).
