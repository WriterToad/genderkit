As botulinum toxin (Botox) is a paralytic, muscles in other parts of the face can accidentally be affected. This can cause unwanted changes to physical appearance.

In a review of medical studies of Botox, common side effects of treatment in the upper face are blepharoptosis (partly closed upper eyelid) in 2.5% of patients studied, brow ptosis (drooping eyebrow) in 3.1%, and eye sensory disorders in 3%.

Common side effects of treatment with Botox in the lower face are lip asymmetries and imbalances, seen in 6.9% of patients studied.

All of these symptoms were temporary {% cite cavallini2014safety %}.

The long-term effects of repeated Botox injections remain unknown and have not yet been studied {% cite gadhia2009facial %}.

For your safety, it is wise to read the advice on choosing who will do the procedure found on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/choosing-who-will-do-your-procedure/).
