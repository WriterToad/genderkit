### How do I get a new driving licence?

You *do not need a GRC* to change the name or gender on your [passport]({% link _articles/getting-a-new-passport.md %}), driving license, or any other identification other than your birth certificate. You can update the name or gender on your driving license regardless of if it is a full or provisional license.

The procedure for updating a driving licence varies between UK nations:

- In *England*, *Wales*, and *Scotland*, you can update the name, title, and photo on your driving licence with a D1 form. You can't update your licence online. You can get D1 forms at a post office or have DVLA [send one to you](https://www.gov.uk/dvlaforms).

- In *Northern Ireland*, you can update name, title, and photo on your driving licence with a DL1 form. You can't update your licence online. You can get DL1 forms at a post office or an MOT test centre.

To update your name on your licence you will need to send your [deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}) or [statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}). Photocopies are not accepted, so you must either send the original document or a [certified copy](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document).

UK driving licences do not have a gender marker but gender is encoded in your driver number {%cite transgenderlaw %}. You may want to write a covering letter asking for the gender of your licence to be changed.

You do not need a doctor's letter to change the gender of your driving licence.

### What else might I want?

If you own a vehicle, you will also want to update its vehicle registration certificate to list your new name. You can find information on how to do this on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-address-v5c).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of updating your driving licence can vary depending on what you are changing - there are full details of costs on [this DVLA page](https://www.gov.uk/driving-licence-fees).

### Where can I learn more?

You can learn more about applying for and updating driving licences on [the DVLA website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-driving-licence).
