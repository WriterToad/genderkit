### How do I stay safe?

{% include get-tested %}

{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen causes development of breast tissue. If you have taken oestrogen, you are at risk of breast cancer.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

There is no recommended method for breast self-examination in the UK, but you should learn how your breast tissue feels and looks and see a doctor if you experience any unexpected changes.

{% include needles optional='true' %}

### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease (problems caused by blood clotting like [deep vein thrombosis](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx)), prolactinoma, [gallstones](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gallstones/Pages/Introduction.aspx), and liver problems. These risks can be reduced by regular blood testing, stopping smoking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle {% cite seal2017 %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
While oestrogen does reduce production of sperm, it does not provide adequate contraception {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %} and does not effectively prevent pregnancy.

### Why might I want oestrogen?

Effects of oestrogen include:

- *Breast development*

  The amount of breast development varies significantly from person to person, can take months to begin, and may not be complete for many years {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}. 

- *Changes in fat distribution*

  Oestrogen can cause an increase in size of hips and buttocks by enlarging skin fat deposits around these areas {% cite seal2017 %}, but this may take up to five years {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}, and does not change the shape of the pelvis (hip bones) in adults. Changes in fat distribution may also cause subtle changes to the appearance of your face.

- *Psychological effects*

  Oestrogen may have positive effects on your mood. Many transgender women taking oestrogen reporting a calmer mood {% cite seal2017 %}. The exact effects vary from person to person.

Oestrogen therapy can also have a number of other effects including changes in skin softness and appearance and body odour. Oestrogen has no effects on the voice, and patients who wish to make changes to their voice should instead consider [speech therapy]({% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %})).

In combination with oestrogen therapy, most people will also wish for testosterone to be reduced. Some endocrinologists may use high doses of oestrogen for testosterone suppression {% cite pg12 -l 12 %}, although this is often unsuccessful and commonly a lower dose of oestrogen in combination with antiandrogens (in the UK, normally [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %})) is the most common approach for testosterone suppression {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

### Why might I not want oestrogen?

When used in combination with an antiandrogen such as [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}), effects of oestrogen therapy that you might find undesirable are:

- *Changes in arousal*

  Oestrogen and antiandrogen therapy can cause changes to sexual arousal, reducing frequency of spontaneous erections {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}, and sometimes making it difficult to maintain erections, and can significantly reduce the amount of ejaculate over time down to little or none {% cite adeleye2019semen -l 138 %}.

- *Changes in libido*

  Oestrogen and antiandrogen therapy can cause changes in interest in sex, often decreased libido {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}.

- *Loss of strength*

  Oestrogen and antiandrogen therapy often causes a significant reduction in strength and muscle mass {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}.

- *Infertility*

  Oestrogen and antiandrogen therapy can reduce sperm quality {% cite adeleye2019semen -l 138 %} and may eventually cause infertility. 

### What kinds are there?

Oestrogen is commonly available in oral (pill or tablet) form, transdermal patches (patches that are stuck to the skin), and gels applied to the skin{% cite seal2017 -l 237 %}. It is very rarely available as an implant, although these are not commonly used. Oestrogen injections are not available in the UK.

There are several different variants of oestrogen available. The two main variants used in the UK are oestradiol valerate (as pills) and oestradiol hemihydrate (as pills, patches, and gel). In the past, ethinylestradiol and conjugated equine oestrogens were used, but these are now avoided because they have a much higher risk of blood clots {% cite toorians2003venous %} and are not detectable in normal blood tests.

{% capture specifics %}
If you have received a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide funding for oestrogen therapy and treatment with GnRH agonists. Oestrogen therapy is not usually provided to under-18s on the NHS, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when oestrogen therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide oestrogen to selected 16 and 17 year old people {% cite gids2016 %}.
