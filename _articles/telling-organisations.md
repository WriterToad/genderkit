### What should I be aware of?

If you are under 16, you may need to supply proof of parental consent.

### Who should I tell?

We've created a checklist of places you might want to notify of a change of names, pronouns or title.

{% include checklist checklist=telling-organisations %}

### What do I do if something goes wrong?

Sometimes organisations will tell you that they are unable to update your name or title.

It's important to remember that to change your name and title:

- you *do not* need to enrol your deed poll
- you *do not* need a deed poll with an official seal or stamp
- you *do not* need a Gender Recognition Certificate

If an organisation is not willing to update your name or title, the following steps can often be useful:

1. *Try a different employee*

   It may be worth asking a different staff member to update your name or title as they may be willing to help you more. This might mean asking to speak to the manager.
1. *Ask why*

   Ask to see a copy of the policy or procedure that says why they can't make a change. Often staff will then discover no such policy exists.
2. *Highlight existing photo ID changes*

   If you have already updated your passport or driving licence, explain that the UK government have already accepted your evidence to make a change of name or title.
3. *Explain their legal obligations*

   The organisation is obligated under UK legislation to update the information they hold about you to keep it accurate - this is the [principle of accuracy](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/accuracy/) (Article 5(1)(d)) and [right to rectification](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/right-to-rectification/) (Article 16) under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
4. *Contact the head office*

   It's often useful to contact the head office of the organisation, rather than a local branch, as they may have a better knowledge of the organisation's processes and of your rights. The easiest way to do this is normally to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook to message the organisation's main social media account. You could also ask staff at the local branch to give you contact details for their head office.
6. *Formally complain by letter*

   If you're still not successful, you can make a formal written request to the organisation asking them to update your information. You can do this using the template on [the Information Commissioner's Office website](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/your-right-to-get-your-data-corrected/) to ensure you are doing this correctly. 
7. *Report the organisation*

   If the organisation still does not update your details, you can read about how to get support to make an official report using the information on [the Information Commissioner's office website](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/).
