### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Silicone filler injections are extremely dangerous and can result in permanent disfigurement {% cite hage2001devastating %} or death {% cite clark2008subcutaneous %}. Do not attempt this.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Silicone injections are different from modern [breast augmentation]({% link _articles/breast-augmentation.md %}), which is significantly safer.

### Are there other options?

You may wish to consider lower risk alternative treatments such as [liposuction](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/liposuction/).
