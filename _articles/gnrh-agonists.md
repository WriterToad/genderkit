### How do I stay safe?
{% include get-tested %}

{% capture warn %}
Taking GnRH agonists without also taking a sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) or inadequate levels of sex hormones can cause osteoporosis or early heart disease {% cite seal2017 %}. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Taking a sex hormone along with GnRH agonists will avoid the risk of osteoporosis or early heart disease. If GnRH agonists are being used without an additional sex hormone, [DEXA (bone density) scans](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dexa-scan/) which measure bone mineral density may be needed {% cite murjan2017 -l 197 %}.

{% capture warn %}
GnRH agonists do not provide reliable contraception {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. They do not remove the risk of making someone pregnant, and they do not remove the risk of becoming pregnant.

### Who might want GnRH agonists?
<section class="info">
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>GnRH agonists are subject to legal restrictions in the UK.</p>
</section>

- *If you have testes*, treatment with GnRH agonists will reduce your testosterone levels. GnRH agonists will cause an initial rise in testosterone levels for the first few weeks of use, which is sometimes stopped by a short course of [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

- *If you have ovaries*, treatment with GnRH agonists will reduce your oestrogen and progesterone levels. This will cause periods to stop, along with halting breast growth. Treatment with GnRH agonists is not normally necessary for people taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) as testosterone normally adequately suppresses production of oestrogen.

- *If you do not have gonads (ovaries and/or testes)*, you will not need to take GnRH agonists. This means that after [orchidectomy]({% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}) or [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), there is no longer any need to use GnRH agonists.

- *If you are going through, or about to start puberty*, GnRH agonists can be used to delay puberty. The effects of GnRH agonists when used in this way are considered a fully reversible treatment {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}, and may reduce the distress of going through the "wrong" puberty {% cite giordano2020 %} as well as the need for some other treatments later in life {% cite wpath7 %}. This is generally considered safe, though there is some evidence that suppressing puberty may have a negative impact on bone development {% cite giordano2020 %}. 

  At present, providing GnRH agonists to people under 18 in the UK is subject to restrictions which means that obtaining GnRH agonists for someone under 18 is normally illegal except in certain specific conditions. You can read more about the situation in [this letter from NHS England](https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/media/3979/nhs-england-letter-31052024.pdf).

### Are there other options?

Alternatives to GnRH agonists include [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}), [spironolactone]({% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}), and [anastrozole]({% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}). 

While these options are cheaper, GnRH agonists are generally preferred by NHS clinicians, as GnRH agonists are considered to have an excellent side-effect profile with minimal side-effects compared to the other alternatives {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}.

{% capture specifics %}
Funding for GnRH treatment is available to people with testes who have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) on the NHS. It was also used by the NHS to prevent puberty in under 18s, and sometimes in conjunction with testosterone treatment to stop menstruation (periods) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %}, but initiation of this treatment on the NHS is now only carried out as part of medical studies.

### How do I use GnRH agonists?

Most GnRH agonists are injections. Usually you will be able to get a doctor or a nurse to perform the injection for you.

### What kinds are there?

Commonly used GnRH agonists in the UK are Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap). Certain clinicians also offer Buserelin (Suprecur/Suprefact) and Nafarelin (Synarel).

GnRH agonists are usually supplied as injections that are administered once every four weeks {% cite prostap zoladex1 %}, twelve weeks {% cite zoladex prostap3 decapeptyl3%}, or six months {% cite decapeptyl %}.

Buserelin and Nafarelin are also available as a nasal spray that is administered twice daily {% cite buserelin nafarelin buserelin-nafarelin-ggp %}; this could be a good option if you have difficulty with needles, but these are not normally prescribed on the NHS, and you will still need to have regular blood tests.

### What else might I want?

GnRH agonists are often used in conjunction with a sex hormone like [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}).

GnRH agonists may cause erectile dysfunction in people with penises. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).
