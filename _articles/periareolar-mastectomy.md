### What should I be aware of?

Complications of mastectomy can include too much or too little tissue removed, "dog ears" (pouches of skin), and hypertrophic or [keloid scars](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/keloid-scars/) {% cite yelland2017 -l 262 %}.

Chest reconstruction surgeries on under 18s who have been on testosterone appear to have similar complications to those in young adults {% cite mahfouda2019 %}, but the research on this is limited.

{% capture warn %}
Not all breast tissue is removed in mastectomy, and it does not remove the risk of breast cancer.

There is no recommended method for breast self-examination in the UK, but you should learn how your breast tissue feels and looks and see a doctor if you experience any unexpected changes.

### How do I get mastectomy?

{% include list-of-surgeons %}

Mastectomy usually requires an overnight stay in hospital {% cite cr181 -l 31 %}. Mastectomy is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend around 4-6 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer.

### Are there other options?

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the [double incision mastectomy]({% link _articles/double-incision-mastectomy.md %}) technique in the UK. Around 7% of people have little enough breast tissue and good skin elasticity for periareolar mastectomy to be recommended instead {% cite yelland2017 -l 261 %}, which can result in less visible scarring {% cite davies2:2007 -l 227 %}. Other techniques are possible, such as buttonhole or inverted T (also known as T-anchor), but are much less common in the UK.

Unlike double incision mastectomy, periareolar mastectomy results in significantly less visible scarring, but may also cause over-reduction of the breast leaving a depression or dip in the chest. Repositioning of nipples cannot be carried out during periareolar mastectomy without leaving very conspicuous scarring, unlike double incision mastectomy {% cite davies2:2007 -l 227 %}.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about chest surgeries in [this booklet from the NHS Gender Dysphoria National Referral Support Service](https://cavuhb.nhs.wales/files/specialised-medicine/welsh-gender-service/v6-top-surgery-leaflet-002-pdf/).

You can also read more about mastectomy on the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mastectomy/).

### How do I get ready for surgery?

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of a mastectomy and chest reconstruction performed in the UK is currently around £6000-7000 (last updated October 2020).

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for a mastectomy. Mastectomy for reasons of gender dysphoria requires a written letter of recommendation from a specialist gender clinician (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery {% cite cr181 %}.
