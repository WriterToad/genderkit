### What kinds are there?

There are two types:

- an *intrauterine device* (IUD) does not release hormones
- an *intrauterine system* (IUS) releases hormones (progestogens), which may help to stop menstruation

Both are believed to not interfere with [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}.

### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Intrauterine devices and intrauterine systems do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Combining an IUD or IUS with the use of barrier methods such as a condom will help reduce this risk.

### Are there other options?

Other options that can also be used while taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) include [contraceptive injections]({% link _articles/contraceptive-injection.md %}), a [contraceptive implant]({% link _articles/contraceptive-implant.md %}), and the progestogen-only [contraceptive pill]({% link _articles/contraceptive-pill.md %}) {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}.

If you are not using testosterone, other options also include contraceptive patches and vaginal rings. You can read more about what types of contraception are right for you on the [Contraception Choices](https://www.contraceptionchoices.org/whats-right-for-me) website.

### How do I get an intrauterine device?

You can ask for an IUD or IUS to be fitted at most GP surgeries, sexual health clinics, and GUM clinics.

### How much does it cost?

An IUD or IUS is available for free at an NHS GP surgery, sexual health, or GUM clinic.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more on the NHS website about [intrauterine devices](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/iud-coil/) and [intrauterine systems](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/ius-intrauterine-system/).
