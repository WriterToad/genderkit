### Why might I want minoxidil?

Minoxidil is normally used to treat hair loss caused by testosterone (androgenic alopecia), and can temporarily slow hair loss and sometimes cause some regrowth.

It may also be helpful for stimulating beard growth if you are unhappy with the amount of facial hair you have {% cite marinelli2024efficacy %}.

### Are there other options?

A commonly used alternative to minoxidil for hair loss is [finasteride]({% link _articles/finasteride.md %}). Unlike minoxidil, finasteride is only available on prescription.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about hair loss treatments at the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hair-loss/).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of Minoxidil is around Â£10-20 per month, with cost varying depending on the quantity bought at a time. You can buy it from a pharmacy or high-street chemist.

Minoxidil is not normally funded by the NHS.
