### What should I be aware of?

The contraceptive implant has a very high effectiveness, but there is still a small (<1%) chance of pregnancy, and some medicines may make the implant less effective {% cite nexplanon %}. Combining the implant with the use of barrier methods such as a condom will reduce the risk of pregnancy even further.

### Why might I want a contraceptive implant?

A contraceptive implant substantially reduces the risk of pregnancy for up to three years. Unlike the [contraceptive pill]({% link _articles/contraceptive-pill.md %}), you do not need to remember to take a pill every day.

For many people the contraceptive implant reduces menstruation (periods) and menstrual pain. For around 1 in 5 people, it stops menstruation entirely, and for around 3 in 4 menstruation will be infrequent {% cite fsrh2014implants nexplanon %}.

Unlike [contraceptive injections]({% link _articles/contraceptive-injection.md %}), when the implant is removed there is not normally a long delay before fertility returns {% cite fsrh2019young %}.

If you are using [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}), the contraceptive implant is believed to be a better choice than the [combined contraceptive pill]({% link _articles/contraceptive-pill.md %}) {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}.

### Why might I not want a contraceptive implant?

You might not want to undergo the surgery to insert and remove the implant. However, the surgery is quick (under 15 minutes) and you will be given a local anaesthetic so it should not be painful.

If you don't want other people to know you are using contraception, an implant might not be the best option for you, as other people may be able feel or see it if they look closely at your arm.

Some people decide they do not want the implant because they experience side effects from the implant, such as headaches, acne, or heavy bleeding. However, not everyone will experience these side effects.

### Are there other options?

Other options that can also be used while taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) include [contraceptive injections]({% link _articles/contraceptive-injection.md %}), progesterone-only contraceptive pills, and most types of IUD {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}.

If you are not using testosterone, other options also include the [combined contraceptive pill]({% link _articles/contraceptive-pill.md %}), patches, and vaginal rings. You can read more about what types of contraception are right for you on the [Contraception Choices](https://www.contraceptionchoices.org/whats-right-for-me) website.

### How do I get a contraceptive implant fitted?

You can ask for a contraceptive implant to be fitted at most GP surgeries, sexual health clinics, and GUM clinics. A GP or nurse makes a small cut in your arm and inserts the implant into your arm using a special tool.

After three years, the implant will need to be removed. You can ask for a new implant to be fitted to replace it during the same surgery.

### How much does it cost?

If fitted at an NHS GP surgery, sexual health, or GUM clinic, the contraceptive implant is provided for free.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about the contraceptive implant on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/contraceptive-implant/).

You can find more information about contraception specifically for transgender and non-binary people on [the FSRH website](https://www.fsrh.org/documents/fsrh-ceu-statement-contraceptive-choices-and-sexual-health-for/contraceptive-choices-and-sexual-health-for-transgender-non-binary-people-oct-2017.pdf).
