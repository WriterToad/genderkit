### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Orchidectomy results in permanent destruction of the testes and is irreversible. After orchidectomy you will be infertile and unable to have children unless you have previously carried out [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (i.e. sperm banking).
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
After orchidectomy, you will need to take at least one sex hormone ([oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) in order to prevent medical problems like osteoporosis.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Orchidectomy may not be suitable for people who are interested in later obtaining a vaginoplasty as it can make the vaginoplasty more difficult - check with your surgeon if you are unsure. 

Orchidectomy may cause erectile dysfunction in people with penises. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).

### How do I get an orchidectomy?

You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.

The NHS gender pathway does not normally fund orchidectomy surgery. However, you can ask your gender service to write a letter to your GP asking them to refer you for an orchidectomy, or you can arrange for one privately.

### Where can I learn more?

You can also read more about orchidectomy in [this booklet from Parkside Hospital](https://cavuhb.nhs.wales/files/specialised-medicine/welsh-gender-service/orchidectomy-2021-pdf/?content-type=application/pdf) who are a UK provider of orchidectomy surgery.

### How do I get ready for surgery?

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of an orchidectomy performed in the UK is currently around £3000-4000 (last updated October 2020).

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for [orchidectomy]({% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}).

{% capture info %}
Outside of Scotland, orchidectomy is usually only funded as part of [vaginoplasty]({% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}), [clitoroplasty]({% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) or [labiaplasty]({% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}).
