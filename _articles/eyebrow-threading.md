### Why might I want eyebrow threading?

Eyebrow threading is a method of reshaping eyebrows. It is a traditional alternative to reshaping eyebrows by [waxing]({% link _articles/waxing.md %}).

Threading can remove stray hairs that are separate from the main eyebrow, reshape the eyebrows or make them thinner, or remove hair from the bottom to make the eyebrows look higher up on the face.

### How do I get eyebrow threading?

Eyebrow threading is carried out in beauty salons. There are currently no national standards for beauty salons, and anyone can legally start a salon in most parts of the country. However, many salons have voluntarily joined professional organisations that maintain registers of beauticians who have a minimum level of educational qualifications to be able to provide safe and hygienic treatment. 

You can search for salons on [the British Association of Beauty Therapy & Cosmetology (BABTAC) database](https://www.babtac.com/salons), or look whether the salon advertises membership of professional organisations such as [the Health and Beauty Industry Authority](https://habia.org/) or [the British Association of Cosmetic Nurses](https://www.bacn.org.uk/).
