### What should I be aware of?

[Speech therapy]({% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %}) is able to allow the majority of people to raise the pitch and change the qualities of their voice safely and easily.

However, for a minority of people this is not the case, and they may consider voice surgery as an alternative.

Unlike speech therapy, voice surgery carries significant risks of complications, and the effects may be irreversible.

Possible side effects of voice surgeries include reduced loudness, decreased vocal range, decreased clarity of voice, and lack of decrease in pitch {% cite song2017transgender -l 806 %}.

While a variety of different surgical approaches to increasing vocal pitch have been tried, there is currently little research into what the long term effects of these surgeries are, and how long the effects will last is unknown {% cite van2017effectiveness -l 244e4 %}.

Depending on the surgical technique, you may have permanent scarring after the operation. Voice surgery also requires additional speech therapy after the surgery {% cite seal:2007 -l 194 %}.

### What else might I want?

[Thyroid chondroplasty]({% link _articles/thyroid-chondroplasty.md %}) is often carried out during surgeries that affect the voice - either to reduce the number of operations required, or because those surgeries would otherwise make the Adam's apple more apparent.
