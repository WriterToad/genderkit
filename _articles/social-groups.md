### How can social groups help?

Social groups can:

- give you an opportunity to meet other trans people in an informal setting
- provide a safe social outlet if you are feeling isolated
- help you make new friends and contacts in the community
- provides a space to work on aspects of your gender identity such as voice and style
- let you build your confidence in being more visibly different

### What should I be aware of?

Social groups are more likely to be organised by individuals not organisations, so you may need to do more research before attending. Here are some steps to consider:

*   Speak to the person who organises the group to find out more about it
*   Ask about the venue and check it is safe
*   Consider whether people will be drinking alcohol and how comfortable you are with that
*   If you know someone who attends, ask them to take you to the next event
*   Some groups will arrange for you to be met at the nearest public transport stop which you may find helpful
*   Are there rules for the event?
*   Do you have a way to leave easily if you need to?

Remember: attending a social group can be useful, but it is important to check that the groupâ€™s events are appropriate for you. Social groups should provide a supportive and safe environment and if you are uncomfortable during an event, you do not have to stay.

### Are there other options?

Other things that can offer some of the same benefits as attending social groups are:

*   [trans support services]({% link _articles/support-services.md %})
*   [support groups]({% link _articles/support-groups.md %})
*   [counselling]({% link _articles/counselling.md %})

You might want to consider these if you do not feel comfortable attending social groups, there are no social groups in your area, or a social group does not fit your needs.
