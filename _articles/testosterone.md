### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Some brands of testosterone contain peanut oil.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Take care to read the ingredients in your medicine if you are allergic to peanuts.

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone use can cause serious medical conditions including polycythaemia (too many red blood cells which can increase stroke risk) and liver problems {% cite seal2017 -l 239 %}. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

To avoid serious side-effects, it is important to only use testosterone under medical supervision with regular blood testing.

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone increases the risk of [obstructive sleep apnoea](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Sleep-apnoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (stopping breathing during sleep) which can lead to heart problems or sudden death. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Symptoms of sleep apnoea include:

- very loud snoring
- noisy and laboured breathing while you are asleep
- stopping breathing followed by gasping or snorting

If you experience any of these symptoms, or you feel constantly tired or fall asleep during the day, speak to your GP. If you normally sleep in a room with someone else, you may wish to tell them the symptoms of sleep apnoea as you will not be awake to observe them.

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone may cause infertility which may be permanent. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

You should consider whether you need to use [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (egg storage).

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone usually causes periods to stop, but does not remove the risk of pregnancy {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. Do not use testosterone as a method of contraception {% cite deroo2017 -l 136 %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Testosterone does not remove the need for [cervical screening tests](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cervical-screening-test/pages/introduction.aspx).

{% capture warn %}
Do not take testosterone if you are pregnant as it can damage a developing foetus {% cite wpath7 fsrh2017contraceptive %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

### Why might I want testosterone?

Testosterone causes a large number of physical changes to your body that you may wish for, including significant changes to body fat distribution, hair growth, pitch of voice.

Testosterone has noticeable effects on mood and thinking, and can increase energy and aggression, but can also help some people feel "more settled" in their body {% cite seal2017 -l 239 %}.

### Why might I not want testosterone?

Many effects of testosterone, such as changes to your voice or body hair, are permanent or not easily reversed. 

You might want some of the effects of testosterone, but not all of them, which may mean testosterone is not the right option for you.

Testosterone may cause acne. You can read more about acne and how to reduce it on the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Acne/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 

### How do I get testosterone?

Most people get testosterone using the UK system for gender medicine. Read [our step-by-step guide to getting medical support]({% link _resources/medical.md %}) for information about using that system. Some people also choose to [access hormones without a medical diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

For testosterone therapy to begin, it is required that any other significant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.

In a small proportion of people menstruation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %} or [progesterone]({% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 %} can be used to do this instead.

In the UK, some clinicians recommend that people taking testosterone long-term should have a [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}). They theorise that as testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which could lead to endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the lining of the womb), this might increase the risk of cancer {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}. However, subsequent studies have not shown any evidence of an increased risk of reproductive cancers from testosterone use, and they do not suggest any need for hysterectomy {% cite toze2018risky %}. Hysterectomy for people taking testosterone is optional and you may feel the risks involved in a major operation are unnecessary. If you decide not to undergo hysterectomy it has been suggested that scans to check for thickening of the endometrium every two years could reduce any potential risks {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}.

### How do I use testosterone?

Testosterone gels and patches are generally fairly easy to apply, and the medicine will come with clear instructions. For testosterone injections, usually you will be able to get a doctor or a nurse to perform the injection for you.

If you need to administer your testosterone injection yourself, Brighton Health and Wellbeing Centre have video guides on how to do this:
* For [Sustanon](https://www.brightonhealthandwellbeingcentre.co.uk/selfcare/b12-sustanon-injections)
* For [Nebido](https://www.brightonhealthandwellbeingcentre.co.uk/selfcare/nebido-decapeptyl-injections)

### What kinds are there?

Testosterone is commonly available as depot injections or as gels applied to the skin {% cite seal2017 -l 241 %}. Oral (pill) forms of testosterone are rarely used as blood testing is more complex, and patches (transdermal testosterone) are rarely used in the UK (partly because of the frequency of bad reactions to patches) {% cite cr181 -l 37 %}.

{% capture specifics %}
If you have received a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide funding for testosterone therapy. Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s on the NHS, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide testosterone to selected 16 and 17 year old people {% cite gids2016 %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include hrt-funding specifics=specifics %}

If you are unable to be prescribed testosterone on the NHS, private prescription fees for commonly used forms of testosterone (as of February 2022) are:

- *testosterone gel*: around £50 for a two month supply
- *testosterone injections*: around £5-6 every 2-4 weeks for Sustanon, £100 for three months for Nebido
