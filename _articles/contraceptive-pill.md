### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Many contraceptive pills contain oestrogen which can interfere with [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) treatment. If you are using testosterone, ask your doctor for a "progesterone-only" contraceptive pill as this will not have this effect {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Combining contraceptive pills with the use of barrier methods such as a condom will reduce the risk of pregnancy even further than using the contraceptive pill alone.

### Are there other options?

Other options that can also be used while taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) include [contraceptive injections]({% link _articles/contraceptive-injection.md %}), a [contraceptive implant]({% link _articles/contraceptive-implant.md %}), and most types of IUD {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}.

If you are not using testosterone, other options also include contraceptive patches and vaginal rings.

### How do I get contraceptive pills?

You can ask for the contraceptive pill at most GP surgeries, sexual health clinics, and GUM clinics. You may wish to ask specifically for the progestogen-only pill (POP) if you are taking testosterone, or if you do not want to take pills containing oestrogen.

### How much does it cost?

The contraceptive pill is available for free at an NHS GP surgery, sexual health, or GUM clinic.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more on the NHS website about [the progestogen-only pill](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/the-pill-progestogen-only/) and [the combined contraceptive pill](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception-guide/pages/combined-contraceptive-pill.aspx).

You can find more information specifically for transgender and non-binary people on [the FSRH website](https://www.fsrh.org/documents/fsrh-ceu-statement-contraceptive-choices-and-sexual-health-for/contraceptive-choices-and-sexual-health-for-transgender-non-binary-people-oct-2017.pdf).
